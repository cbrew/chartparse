Chart Parser written in Python for CSE732 (Spring 2009)

A loose adaptation for Python Steve Isard's LIB CHART (part of the Poplog system).
Some of the names are the same, but Steve is not to blame for anything that this
does, except perhaps the grammar. This last was designed to amuse Experimental
Psychology students in 1983 or so.

Needs: Python 2.5 or 2.6  (other 2.x versions may work)  http://www.python.org/

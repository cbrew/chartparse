    Attributes
    ----------
    label : string
        the mother node of the constituent.
    left: integer [0..n]
        the index of the left boundary of the edge.
    right: integer[0..n]
        the index of the right boundary of the edge.
    needed: strings
        strings representing the categories that the edge needs.
    constraints: set(string)
        features inherited from the spawning rule.

    Parameters
    ----------
    label : string
        the mother node of the constituent.
    left: integer [0..n]
        the index of the left boundary of the edge.
    right: integer[0..n]
        the index of the right boundary of the edge.
    needed: strings
        strings representing the categories that the edge needs.
